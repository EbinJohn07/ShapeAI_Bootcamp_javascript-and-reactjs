      The bootcamp was organised by ShapeAI for 7 days. It was a very intersting and useful session.
      The classes were based on the basics of html,javascript and reactjs.
      It really helped me in learning new skills which would benefit for me 
      in my future career and skill development.I was really filled with happiness and satisfaction
      when I completed the project too.All thanks to ShapeAI for this and I hope
      ShapeAI would bring more bootcamps like these in the future and I look forward in joining those.
